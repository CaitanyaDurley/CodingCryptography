# Coding and cryptography

This repo contains a couple of python scripts I made to investigate topics within the Coding & Cryptography course at my university.

## 12Coins
Solves the 12 coin problem (actually the m-coin problem for any m) by maximising entropy at each stage

## Huffman
Generates optimal binary codes using Huffman's algorithm
